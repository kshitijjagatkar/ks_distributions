## Installation

The code should run with no issues using Python versions >3.6.
Step: package can be install like usual method

use  "from package_name import class"  in your cmd prompt

package_name:  ks_distributions

class: 1. Gaussian 2. Binomial

eg. from ks_distributions import Gaussian, Binomial

## Project Motivation

wanted to create a simple package and upload to Pypi using python oops knowledge.

## Functionalities

So, Here comes the main part. The main purpose of this is to find the Mean, Standard Deviation of distribution and add them accordingly.
Then I add one more class Binomial which tells us same mean and std deviation by taking input of (probability, n-events)
