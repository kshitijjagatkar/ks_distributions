# A Python Package of Gaussian & Binomial Distribution
Created a python package which add two gaussian or binomial distributions

4. File Descriptions
5. Summary
6. Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements

## Installation

The code should run with no issues using Python versions >3.6.
Step: package can be install in usual way

use  "from package_name import class"  in your cmd prompt

package_name:  ks_distributions
class: 1. Gaussian 2. Binomial

eg. *from ks_distributions import Gaussian, Binomial*

## Project Motivation

Wanted to create a simple python package using OOP knowledge for flexibility calculating various methods.

## Functionalities

The main purpose of this is to find the Mean, Standard Deviation, probability density function of distribution and how can we add two distributions.

## File Descriptions

So, very first file you will see is setup.py which is essential for creating a package it has discription of this package. In the "ks-distribution" folder you will
find main python code for distributions. I have also provided one more README file in the folder containing more information about those files, do check it.

## Summary 

If I would have to put straight then you can calculate mean, std deviation, pdf, pmf of both gaussian and binomial directly from this package with histogram and bar
futher saying you can add two distributions too. Hope this finds you interesting, If you are doing something related to this then do check this package and let me know if it useful. Feel free to give suggestions if any.
