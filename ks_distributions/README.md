# ks-distribution Package

## Files

1.  Generaldistributions - Main Class(parent)
2.  Gaussiandistributions  -  child class
3.  Binomialdistributions  -  child class

## Functionalities
    File Tour

1.  Generaldistributions: I initialize some instance variables and a method for reading a file.

2.  Gaussiandistributions:  Here, started with a method of calculating mean, standard deviation, probability density function, Plotting histograms,
                            and adding & printing two distributions using magic methods.
                            
3.  Binomialdistribution: In this file, I inherited one more class "Binomial" from our parent class "distributions" with some methods as which calculates mean, 
                          standard deviation, probability mass function, method for plotting bar of the data, and finally method for adding and printing two 
                          binomial distributions.
                          
  ### Summery
  
  So, I hope this description clear my moto. further I would like to say that python does provide functions to calculate each individual not everything though but from
  my experience for learning purspose I have to calculate some of these term repeatedly so thought and ended up to this package. Let me know if you face any problem or wanna
  give any suggestions.
